I thought it might be a good idea to try out this website thing.

I mostly work on back-end data processing at work, so it's been interesting getting acquainted with some front-end web stuff. I'm using [Hyde](http://ringce.com/hyde) to generate my site statically, and [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) to host it. The main reason I chose Hyde over [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) (which was written by one of the GitHub guys and integrated into Pages) is because Hyde is written in Python. I can open it up and understand what's going on without having to pick up another programming language. I don't think there's anything wrong with Ruby, but I don't know it, so I'd rather take things one step at a time.

Hyde's documentation is a little sparse, but the source is fairly easy to walk through. It comes with two example layouts, and [my source](https://github.com/aduffey/andrewduffey.com) is available over on GitHub.

I've used a lot of markup and CSS from [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com/) as well. It's an interesting (and useful!) project.
